<small>Fast predictions of RNA-protein interactions and domains</small>
</h1>


<p>
We introduce the catRAPID algorithm to predict RNA-protein associations. 
Using the information contained in protein and RNA sequences, we generate models of secondary structures and combine them with
 phenomenological potentials for hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contributions to predict RNA-protein interactions.
</p>

<p>
Using catRapid is quite easy. Just follow <a href="@{Application.main(params.bundle,'catrapid')}" >this link</a>, fill the form with your protein and RNA sequences and submit your request.  
</p>


<p>
A typical output is displayed below: <br/>

Note that the contrast in these plots is automatically adjusted to high-light significant regions
involved in protein-RNA interactions.
